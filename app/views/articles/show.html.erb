  <%# Like with any blog, our readers will create their comments directly after reading the article, %>
  <%# and once they have added their comment, will be sent back to the article show page to see their comment now listed.  %>
  <%# Due to this, our CommentsController is there to provide a method to create comments and delete spam comments when they arrive. %>

  <%# This adds a form on the Article show page that creates a new comment by calling the CommentsController create action.  %>
  <%# The form_with call here uses an array, which will build a nested route, such as /articles/1/comments. %>
