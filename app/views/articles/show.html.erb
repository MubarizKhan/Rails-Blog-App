  <%# Like with any blog, our readers will create their comments directly after reading the article, %>
  <%# and once they have added their comment, will be sent back to the article show page to see their comment now listed.  %>
  <%# Due to this, our CommentsController is there to provide a method to create comments and delete spam comments when they arrive. %>

  <%# This adds a form on the Article show page that creates a new comment by calling the CommentsController create action.  %>
  <%# The form_with call here uses an array, which will build a nested route, such as /articles/1/comments. %>

  <h2> Add a comment </h2>
  <%= form_with model: [ @article, @article.comments.build ] do |form| %>

      <%= form.label :commenter %><br>
      <%= form.text_field :commenter %>

    <p>
      <%= form.label :body %>
      <%= form.text_area :body %>

    <p> <%= form.submit %> </p>
